# Dynamic Programming Euler's Number

The mathematical constant $e$ (Euler's number) is defined as follows:

$$ e = \sum^{\infty}_{i=0} \frac{1}{i!} = \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1} +
\frac{1}{1\cdot 2} + \frac{1}{1\cdot 2\cdot 3} + \frac{1}{1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot
4} + \ldots$$

I've provided an implementation of a function to approximate $e$ up to a number
of $n$ terms in `code.js` for you. However, it does repeated work -- identify
where the repeated work occurs and avoid it through bottom-up dynamic
programming (not memoization). Change the implementation accordingly.

Test your new functions; I've provided some basic testing code in `code.test.js`
but you need to go beyond that.

## Runtime Analysis

What is the worst-case big $\Theta$ time complexity of your algorithm?

### Analysis
The worst-case for my bottom up function is $\Theta(n)$ because I have one if else statement, the if is constant time and the else has one for loop. That for loop iterates from i=1 to i <= n; so the complexity is $\Theta(n)$, values are updated in the for loop but all in constant time. <br/>
<br/>
I looked at classmates analyses to confirm my analysis and I then added a little extra about the rest being constant time.
